# Portfolio Game Engine
This is a game engine I have created to show off my abilities in engine programming. For this engine, I use C++ with OpenGL, OpenAL, and possibly PhysX once I get arround to adding a physics handler.

Hopeful TODOS (however not very likely):
  - Port to WiiU
  - Port to 3DS
  - Note: I know these consoles are getting outdated, however they are the only consoles where I have access to the SDKs.
